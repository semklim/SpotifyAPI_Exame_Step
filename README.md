# Spotify Demo version

This project is a exame project that aims to help me and my command learn how to use the Spotify Web API, built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application uses the Spotify Web API to retrieve data about artists, albums, and tracks, and presents it in a user-friendly way.

## Getting Started

1) Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/semklim/SpotifyAPI_Exame_Step.git
```
2) Navigate to the cloned directory:

```bash
cd SpotifyAPI_Exame_Step
```
3) Finally, open the ```index.html``` file in your web browser. The application should load automatically and prompt you to authenticate with your Spotify account. Once you've authenticated, you'll be able to search for artists, albums, and tracks and see information about them.

## Features 
The application includes the following features:
- Authentication with the Spotify Web API using OAuth 2.0
- Selection of playlists by genre
- Display information about artists, albums, and tracks, including album covers, track lists, and release dates
- Play track previews by clicking on a track
- Save tracks as favorites
- View a list of favorite tracks
